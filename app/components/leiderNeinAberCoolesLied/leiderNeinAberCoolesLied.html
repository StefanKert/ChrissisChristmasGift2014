		<div id="lyrics">
			When your legs don't work like they used to before<br>
			And I can't sweep you off of your feet<br>
			Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love<br>
			Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks<br>
			<br>
			And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70<br>
			And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23<br>
			And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways<br>
			Maybe just the touch of a hand<br>
			Oh me I fall in love with you every single day<br>
			And I just wanna tell you I am<br>
			<br>
			So honey now<br>
			Take me into your loving arms<br>
			Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
			Place your head on my beating heart<br>
			I'm thinking out loud<br>
			Maybe we found love right where we are<br>
			<br>
			When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades<br>
			And the crowds don't remember my name<br>
			When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm<br>
			I know you will still love me the same<br>
			<br>
			'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen<br>
			Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory<br>
			<br>
			I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways<br>
			Maybe it's all part of a plan<br>
			I just keep on making the same mistakes<br>
			Hoping that you'll understand<br>
			<br>
			But baby now<br>
			Take me into your loving arms<br>
			Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
			Place your head on my beating heart<br>
			I'm thinking out loud<br>
			That maybe we found love right where we are, oh<br>
			<br>
			(Ah la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la)<br>
			<br>
			So baby now<br>
			Take me into your loving arms<br>
			Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
			Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart<br>
			I'm thinking out loud<br>
			That maybe we found love right where we are<br>
			<br>
			Oh maybe we found love right where we are<br>
			And we found love right where we are
